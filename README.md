## Welcome to my VIM configuration files

This branch will remain active in case someone is interested on my old vim configuration

I plan to keep this from time to time mantained but I can't promise anything.

## Colaboration?

Feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate and still mantain this branch.

## Info

Reason I'm moving on, is because I went back to VSCODE



JAJAJAJA NEVER!


I moved my configuration to LUA
